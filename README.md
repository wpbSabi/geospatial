The ipython notebook creates an interactive HTML map. There is a tooltip that shares the grocery store name for each marker.

The map captures all 33 stores from the 2015 market study.
* **Red**: Stores that have closed since the 2015 market study
* **Green**: Stores that have opened since the 2015 market study or were not captured *PLEASE HELP WITH SHARING ANYTHING I MISSED*
* **Blue**: Albertson's, Fred Meyer, Grocery Outlet, QFC, Safeway, Trader Joe's, Winco, 
* **Orange**: New Season's, Whole Foods
* **Purple**: Co-ops
