# Market Visualization for Grocery Stores near the Montavilla Neighborhood 

To run, open `East Portland Grocery Stores.ipynb` with jupyter notebook.

The notebook creates an [interactive HTML map](https://wpbsabi.github.io/geospatial/). There is a tooltip that shares the grocery store name for each marker, and you are able to zoom into street-level detail if you'd like.

The map captures all 33 stores from the 2015 market study.
* **Red**: Stores that have closed since the 2015 market study
* **Green**: Stores that have opened since the 2015 market study or were not captured *Please do let me know if I have missed any new stores that have opened since*
* **Blue**: Albertson's, Fred Meyer, Grocery Outlet, QFC, Safeway, Trader Joe's, Winco, 
* **Orange**: New Season's, Whole Foods
* **Purple**: Co-ops
